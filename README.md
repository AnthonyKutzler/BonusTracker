# BonusTracker

This was created to convert a vertical list of people and hours into a horizontal list, for use with CNC's monthly bonus system. 
Which is later used to pay an additional prorated ammount for any OT hours throughout the month.

Pivot tables in excel don't work for this, because the data for each person is spread across 2 lines.
